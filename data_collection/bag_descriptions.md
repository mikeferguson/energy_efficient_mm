## Description of bagfiles

A number of the UBR-1 metrics were generated from data collected during life testing,
however, the following bags are the basis of several specific points, and were used
to generate the graphs in the paper.

 * ubr1_arm_trajectory.bag - this is the recorded output of ubr1_arm_trajectory.
   Runs the shoulder pan joint through several velocities/accelerations.
 * ubr1_teleop_base.bag - recording of the robot driving around at several
   velocities and accelerations.
 * ubr1_base_dataset_7.bag - navigation data, robot_debug is recorded at
   a lower framerate.
 * ubr1_arm_static_path_9.bag - example bag file of the disco-test movement.
   robot_debug is recorded at a lower framerate.
 * ubr1_arm_moveit_8.bag - example bag file of the arm test that uses moveit.
   robot_debug is recorded at a lower framerate.
